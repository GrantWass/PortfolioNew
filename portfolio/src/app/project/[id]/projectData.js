      "This project came from my curiosity about where I run the most. After taking a web development class, I wanted to apply what Iâ€™d learned to something both practical and fun. I figured out how to use the Google Maps API to show my running routes and the Garmin Connect API to pull in my running data. It was my first time dealing with external APIs and messy data, and it made me realize I needed a more performant backend, which led to learning about caching, batching, and concurrency. Plus, having full control over the design let me try out different UI ideas and layouts.",

      "This was my first web development project, where I started with no prior knowledge and learned the fundamentals of web development. Throughout this project, I became proficient in React, TypeScript, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. In addition to these languages and tools, I gained experience in teamwork, including branch management, agile methodology, and project management. At the time, these concepts were entirely new to me, making this project a significant learning opportunity. I also explored user management and authentication, modern web development architecture, and implemented web sockets for real-time gameplay.",

I gained practical experience with React, TypeScript, and state management for real-time UI updates. Implementing backpropagation manually helped solidify key machine learning concepts. I also learned how to design user-friendly visualizations for complex topics, and improved my ability to communicate technical processes interactively. Hosting and deployment further taught me how to bring standalone projects to production.",
