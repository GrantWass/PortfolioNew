    description: 'My journey to coding started my senior year of high school when I took a simple coding class and immediately loved it. I found that coding provided the balance I was looking for between mathematics and logical thinkingâ€”my strengths. I wanted to apply these skills to a career that allowed for non-repetitive work, creative thinking, and problem solving. That simple class, which primarily used code.org, opened my eyes to the world of programming. I dove headfirst into computer science during my freshman year of college and have not looked back since. I love coding, solving real problems, and leveraging my logical strengths. Today, I am passionate about building applications that not only meet needs but also challenge me to think critically and innovate. Each project is an opportunity for growth, collaboration, and creativity, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me in the future.',

I have a goal to climb all of Colorado\'s 14ers and have climbed 9 so far. My plan in the near future is to go on a backpacking trip in either Colorado or the Pacific Northwest and I have already started purchasing gear for the trip. Nature is beautiful and I love being in it.',

I\'ve been a competitive runner since middle school and now continue to compete at the collegiate level at Nebraska. Through running, I\'ve learned discipline, hard work, and the ability to push beyond my limits. Balancing 80-mile weeks, academics, and a part-time job has also taught me valuable time management skills. Running has opened doors for me to travel, compete, and pursue my passion, and I\'m incredibly grateful for these opportunities. It will always be a key part of my identity. For those curious, my mile PR is 4:14, and my favorite race is the indoor 3K.',
